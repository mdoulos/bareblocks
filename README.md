This theme was designed to be the foundation for a custom WordPress theme. It is a barebones theme that includes only the most essential files and code with the exception that a couple of useful features are built-in that help organization.

I created this theme because I was frustrated with other bare bones themes advertised for Wordpress. They typically contained more than what was necessary and I had to modify the files everytime when setting up a new website instead of simply setting up a new website.
